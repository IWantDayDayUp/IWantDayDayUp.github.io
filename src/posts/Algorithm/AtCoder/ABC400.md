## 📌 C - 2^a b^2

![400C](https://github.com/IWantDayDayUp/picx-images-hosting/raw/master/ABC/400C.13lyjstw74.png)

Since the function $2^a$ grows very quickly, we can consider enumerating values of $a$ and calculate the valid ranges of $b$ accordingly

So, if we fix a value of $a$, we can move $2^a$ to the right-hand side:

$$1 \le b^2 \le \frac{n}{2^a}$$

As $b^2$ increases with $b$, we can binary search to find the maximum valid $b$

We can further optimize the step, take the square root on both sides gives:

$$1 \le b \le \sqrt{\frac{n}{2^a}}$$

So the number of valid $b$ is:

$$\left\lfloor \sqrt{\frac{n}{2^a}} \right\rfloor$$

```cpp
// TayLock

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

long long isqrt(long long n)
{
    long long x = sqrt(n);
    if (x * x > n)
    {
        x--;
    }
    return x;
}

int main()
{
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);

    long long n;
    cin >> n;

    cout << isqrt(n / 2) + isqrt(n / 4) << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## 📌 D - Takahashi the Wall Breaker

![400D](https://github.com/IWantDayDayUp/picx-images-hosting/raw/master/ABC/400D.6t7avdo9qa.png)

For each coordinate point on the grid, enumerate the positions it can move to:

- Move to adjacent position(up, down, left, right) that are within the town and road tiles: for each point, there are at most $4$ such valid positions. Simply brute-force enumerate these points and connect them with edges of weight $0$
- Choose one of the four directions(up, down, left, right) and perform a **forward kick**: for each point, ther are at most $8$ such valid positions. Again, brute-force enumerate these points and connect them with edegs of weight $1$

It is easy to observe that the answer is the shortest path distance from `(A, B)` to `(C, D)` on this graph. Since the graph only contains edegs with weight $0$ and $1$, we can use `0-1 BFS` to solve the problem in $O(HW)$ time

::: tip
`0-1 BFS` is basically equivalent to `Dijkstra` algorithm, except that we use a `deque` instead of a `priority queue` by exploiting the property that tentative distances of vertices that are inserted to the deque differ at most by one, enabling us to solving the original problem in a total of $O(HW)$ time

🥇 Why better:

- We only process each cell once, and we assign the shortest possible cost to reach that cell
  - we might push the same cell multiple times with different costs, which can lead to redundant computation, or even infinite loops in cyclic graphs

```cpp
    // once you visit a cell with the minimum cost, you never need to revisit it
    // because deque guarantees that any later visit will have equal or worse cost
    if (dis[x][y] != -1)
    {
        continue;
    }

    // sets the minimum cost to reach cell (x, y), we only do this once
    dis[x][y] = d;
```

## 📌 E - Ringo's Favorite Numbers 3

![400E](https://github.com/IWantDayDayUp/picx-images-hosting/raw/master/ABC/400E.3rbeu5mxj8.png)

The condition for a **400 number** is equivalent to that **$N$ is a square number**

Since there are only $10^6$ square numbers not greater than $10^12$, so we will check each of them whether it is a 400 number to enumerate 400 numbers

The number of distinct prime factors of $k = 1, 2, 3, ..., 10^6$ can be found in the same manner as **Eratosthenes' sieve**:

- Initialize a sequence $V = (V_1, V_2, ..., V_{10^6})$ with $0$
- For each prime $p$ not greater than $10^6$, add $1$ to $V_i$ for every $i$ that is a multiple of $p$
- Then the final $V_i$ is the number of distinct prime factors of $i$

Once we enumerate all the 400 numbers not greater than $10^12$, one can perform a binary search against the sorted list of the 400 numbers to find the maximum 400 numbers less than or equal to $A$

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);

    int A = 1e6 + 1;
    vector<int> v(A);

    // Eratosthenes’ sieve
    // Then the final V_i is the number of distinct prime factors of i
    for (int i = 2; i < A; i++)
    {
        if (v[i] == 0)
        {
            for (int j = i; j < A; j += i)
            {
                v[j]++;
            }
        }
    }

    // generate all valid 400 numbers
    vector<long long> vec;
    for (long long i = 2; i < A; i++)
    {
        if (v[i] == 2)
        {
            vec.push_back(i * i);
        }
    }

    int q;
    cin >> q;

    while (q--)
    {
        long long a;
        cin >> a;

        // binary search
        cout << *prev(upper_bound(vec.begin(), vec.end(), a)) << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

```cpp

// minp[i]: the smallest prime dividing i

// linear sieve
void sieve(int n)
{
    minp.assign(n + 1, 0);
    primes.clear();
    np.assign(n + 1, 0);

    for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++)
    {
        // find a prime
        if (minp[i] == 0)
        {
            // one prime factor: itself
            minp[i] = i;
            np[i] = 1;

            primes.push_back(i);
        }

        // mark multiples of i
        for (auto p : primes)
        {
            if (i * p > n)
            {
                break;

            } else {
                // it's a new prime
                np[i * p] = np[i] + 1;
            }

        }
    }

    // prefix max array
    lst.resize(n + 1);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)

    }

        a *= a;

        cout << a << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

🥇 Why better:

- Linear sieve(`sieve` function):
  - Finds all prime numbers up to $n$
  - Computes the number of distinct prime factors of each number $i$ as `np[i]`
  - Builds a lookup array `lst[i]`, which for each $i$, stores the largest number $\le i$ such that `np[i] == 2`(i.e., $i$ has exactly $2$ distinct prime factors)

## 📌 F - Happy Birthday! 3

![400F](https://github.com/IWantDayDayUp/picx-images-hosting/raw/master/ABC/400F.45v6mr51i.png)

Considering the operation in reverse order, the problem can be rephrased as follows:

::: info
Each piece $i$ is initially painted in color $C_i$. Find the minimum total cost required to make all pieces to have color `0` by repeating the following operation:

- Choose $a, b, c$ such that each of the pieces $a, a + 1, ..., a + b - 1$ have color `0` or `c`(i.e., we want $C_i \rightarrow 0$)
- Paint the pieces $a, a + 1, ..., a + b - 1$ in color `0` for a cost $b + X_c$

:::

::: note Why no operation can overlap with a previously painted segment?
If we could overlap operations, we could re-paint slices with conflicting colors, causing confusion and making it harder to determine the **minimum cost** needed to reach the target color configuration
:::

We may assume that piece $a$ and $a + b - 1$ is always painted in color $c$

::: tip
Otherwise, the required cost is reduced by shrinking the segment
:::

- Understanding the operation cost: the cost of painting a segment of the cake is determined by two factors

  - The length $b$ of the segment being painted(i.e., how many slices we affect)
  - The coloring cost $X_C$ which is associated with the color we choose for the segment

The key idea is to **divide the circular problem into smaller sequential problems** using `Dynamic Programming (DP)`. Here's how it works::

- Suppose the last operation we performed was on the slices from $a$ to $a + b - 1$ and painted these slices with color $c$. After this operation, these slices $a, a + 1, ..., a + b - 1$ are locked into color $c$, meaning that no subsequent operation can affect these slices
- Since the slices from $a$ to $a + b - 1$ are already painted, they do not interfere with the left or right parts. Then we can divide the problem into two independent parts:
  - Left side: The slices before $a$(from slice $1$ to $a - 1$)
  - Right side: The slices after $a + b - 1$(from slice $a + b$ to $N$)
  - We can use dynamic programming independently compute the minimum cost to color the left and right segments, and then combine the results to get the total cost
- The minimum cost to color slices from $a$ to $a + b − 1$ with color `0` (and the rest of the cake with color `0`) can be found as the sum of:
  - The minimum cost to color slices $a, a + 1, ..., a + b - 1$ with color `0`
  - The minimum cost to color all the other slices(i.e., the left and right part) independently

::: important
Define `dp[l,r]` as the minimum cost required to color slices from $l$ to $r - 1$, such that the last operation involved coloring the slices $l, l + 1, ..., r - 1$. For each pair of subproblems, we need to compute the minimum cost recursively by considering all possible last positions and dividing the problem
:::

DP transition:

- First, suppose that the last operation was performed against pieces $l, l + 1, ..., r - 1$
  - Let's say the last operation was performed against pieces $l', l' + 1, ..., r' - 1$, and $l != l'$ or $r != r'$
  - if $l != l'$, then $l, l + 1, ..., l' - 1$ and $l', l' + 1, ..., r - 1$ can be considered independently
  - if $r != r'$, then $l, l + 1, ..., r' - 1$ and $r', r' + 1, ..., r - 1$ can be considered independently
  - Therefore the minimum cost for this case is the minimum value of $dp_{l, m} + dp_{m, r}$ for $m$ with $l < m < r$
- Next, suppose that the last operation was performed against pieces $l, l + 1, ..., r - 1$, the sought cost is the minimum cost required to make each of pieces $l, l + 1, ..., r - 1$ color `0` of color $C_l$, plus $r - l + X_{C_l}$, note that piece $l$ remains color $C_l$
  - make piece $r - 1$ color $0$: $dp_{l, r} = min(dp_{l, r}, min(dp_{l, m} + dp_{m, r}))$
  - make piece $r - 1$ color $C_l$: $dp_{l, r} = min(dp_{l, r}, dp_{l, r - 1})$ if $C_{r - 1} = C_l$
- The final answer can be found as $\min_{0 \le i < N}{dp_{i, N + i}}$
